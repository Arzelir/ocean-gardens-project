    For years, NASA has been playing a big part in scientific discoveries around Earth. These discoveries have allowed
    us to improve our way of living, teaching us how to take better care of our planet. Even with Nasa’s significant
    research efforts, the ocean remains one of the most unknown parts of this world, where only 5% of all oceans have
    been explored. With this came the ocean gardens challenge. This challenge allows us to explore and learn about a
    major part of our ocean’s ecosystem. Our challenge entails us to research and create an accessible platform that
    visually educates users on how big of an impact the ocean has on our everyday lives and how important the ocean is
    to those who don’t have much knowledge on the subject.

    We were interested in the impact phytoplankton had on our ocean’s ecosystem and how much it affects our daily lives.
    Phytoplankton makes up about 70% of the oceans, but it isn’t talked about much when we talk about the damage being
    done to the ocean with plastic, oil, and pollution. The impact it has on global warming and the dangers of letting
    this marine plant grow out of control is detrimental to our lives. The phytoplankton is the base of any ocean food
    web and helps with our climate system by intaking the carbon in the air and dying with it, letting it sink into the
    deep seas. Phytoplankton helps marine life to thrive in an environment that is slowly being destroyed. We hope to
    educate those about the importance of this marine plant and raise awareness for the ocean’s ecosystem.
