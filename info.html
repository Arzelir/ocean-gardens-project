        What are Phytoplankton
</h2>

<p>
    <!-- TO DO: Find out how to change width of text block -->
        Phytoplankton intake a significant amount of carbon dioxide and produce roughly 50% of the oxygen we breathe. They are microscopic marine algae, similar to plants on land. There are different species of phytoplankton including bacteria, protists, and most commonly, single-celled plants. Most phytoplankton stay in the upper part of the ocean where the sunlight can reach them. When there is a surplus of nutrients available, it is common for them to grow out of control. When this happens, phytoplankton produce a toxic compound that is harmful to many animals that live near water and even people.

        Phytoplanktons Across the Oceans
</h2>

<p>
    <!-- TO DO: Find out how to change width of text block -->
        Phytoplankton are more common around the north and south poles as well as the equator where nutrients are more common. They live in high altitude areas where there is a higher amount of sunlight. Winds also affect the distribution of phytoplankton as the wind can cause currents that bring more nutrients to the surface of the water.

<h2>
        Why is Phytoplankton Important
</h2>
<p>
    <!-- TO DO: Find out how to change width of text block -->
        Phytoplankton are the base of any oceanic food web. They help transform inorganic carbon from the atmosphere and the sea into organic compounds, which makes them an essential part of the Earthâ€™s carbon cycle. When they take the carbon dioxide, they die and sink into the deep sea, which helps our climate system, lessening our ever rising global warming. Because Phytoplankton thrives on the iron in the ocean, the scarcity of this iron results in people  discussing how to fertilize these areas with iron to promote blooming that will help transfer more carbon into the deep seas.
